# Analytics Challenge

## Situation

### Our NGO
Our NGO supports vaccinations that save millions of children’s lives each year as a part of reaching their ESG targets.

##### Context
A non-governmental organisation (NGO) that funds vaccinations for children in lower income regions.
Each year, our NGO spends millions to get vaccinations to where they are needed the most.
Since it launched, our NGO has supported immunisation of more than 580 million children and averted more than 8 million premature deaths. 

##### Maximising the aid effort
Each year, funds have to be allocated across regions, countries, and types of immunisations.


### Funding vaccinations around the world
The vaccination strategy has to focus both on short and long term goals - immediately saving lives and pursuing sustainability.

##### Prioritising across countries and immunisations
Immunisation funds are targeted at regions where there would otherwise be an undersupply and lives are at stake.
Immunisations for diseases that pose an immediate risk to children are targeted.
Specific factors play a role:  

* some immunisations require multiple doses at separate times  
* some diseases are on the brink of eradication

## Challenge
Generate data insights to effectively support a worldwide vaccination effort.


### Description and deliverables
Use cutting-edge analytics to come up with a strategy that ensures funds for vaccinations have maximum impact.

##### Challenge description

Each year, our NGO has to allocate its budget across immunisation types and countries. This allocation of funds plays a crucial role in determining how effective the immunisation initiative is (i.e., how many lives are saved as a result of it).
Our NGO has approached you, a team of independent analytics consultants, to help them plan their investments for the next 5 years. They are looking for a recommendation for how much to invest in what immunisations and what countries.

##### The challenge
**Insightful visualisation**
Help the NGO understand where to invest the available money to save most children's lives. Visualise the data in a meaningful way using bar charts / line charts /scatter plot etc. and make a recommendation to the NGO where their money can be deployed most effectively.



### Data sources
You will be relying on data sets that are open to the public – and are you free to add your own data (if openly available). In order to get rapidly started, and because you have very limited time for this challenge, we've prepared a simplified dataset.

##### Summarized data  
* [Dataset for the WIT Challenge](https://github.com/DeloitteHackathon/AnalyticsChallenge/blob/master/Data/Dataset%20for%20the%20WIT%20Challenge%20.csv)

##### NGO data  
* [Detailed information on NGO’s disbursement from 2000 to 2016](https://github.com/DeloitteHackathon/AnalyticsChallenge/blob/master/Data/NGO_DataDisbursement.csv)


##### WHO data  
* [Coverage by vaccines for each country 1980-2015](https://github.com/DeloitteHackathon/AnalyticsChallenge/blob/master/Data/WHO_Coverage_estimates.csv)  


##### World bank data
* Birth rate, death rate, life expectancy, fertility rate, …
* Prevalence of obesity, malnourishment, vaccine waste
* International migrant numbers, net migration, refugee population by country or territory of origin 
* GDP, poverty headcount
* Air pollution, improved sanitation facilities, water source


Ideas for supplementary data:
* Number of reported cases of Haemophilus influenzae Disease (Including HiB)  
* Forecasts of epidemics  
* Forecast of destabilizing elections
* GDP growth (meaning country can found own effort)
* Data on innovations for new ways of delivering vaccines in difficult circumstances 
* etc.



### Hints
Do not get overwhelmed by the data and remember to enjoy yourselves!

* You don’t have much time to come up with the final presentation, so possibly split the work between team members.
* Half the work is formalizing the problem. You will have to make assumptions. Make sure you explain why you made them.
* Check the data you are provided: even though we already did quite some cleaning for you, check whether the data you work with is consistent and exclude data points where needed.
* We are dealing with a serious topic but after all this is just a fun challenge. Try to wow us and your competitors with cool visualisations and solid analysis. (Remember however: the recommendation is the final product of your work) 


### Presentation
Each team will present their work in front of a group of judges

##### Format
* 1 min pitch
* 1 min Feedback

##### Content
* Introduce team
* Problem Statement
* Presentation of solution



### Tools
Use any of the tools listed below or your own choice, provided the tool is available for free. 

##### Code
All code used must be open sourced. It can be existing code, new code written for the hackathon project, or a combination, but all code must be open sourced and licensed appropriately.


##### Data Visualisation (options available)
* PowerBI [(link)](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)
* Tableau [(trial available)](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students)

##### Language (options available)
* R – Shiny, Plotly
* Python – Pandas, Bokeh
* Matlab 
* SQL – Backend MS SQLServer

### Evaluations
A number of clearly defined criteria will be used in the evaluation of your work. Each team’s work will be evaluated as a whole.

##### Analytics
* Clearly state hypothesis
* Data indentification and integrity

##### Visualisations
* Direct attention to the key message
* Appropriate chart type with accurate units of measurement
* Visuals are appealing

##### Presentation
* Provides clear, data driven and actionable recommendations for the initial business problem
* Tells a compelling story
* Is well-structured and within the time limit

## Logistics

### Teams  
Good collaboration within the team will be key success factor. 

Each participant will be part of a team of 3-4 people.
People are free to team up as they wish (we recommend a good mix of skillsets in the same team: technical, business and presentation skills). 

We suggest that you look for the following qualities in your team:
* Experience with data visualisation
* Experience with statistics/machine learning
* Experience with business presentations/pitches
