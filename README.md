# Analytics Challenge

## Situation

### Our NGO
Our NGO supports vaccinations that save millions of children’s lives each year – but many more still need immunisations.

##### Context
A non-governmental organisation (NGO) that funds vaccinations for children in lower income regions.
Each year, our NGO spends millions to get vaccinations to where they are needed the most.
Since it launched, our NGO has supported immunisation of more than 580 million children and averted more than 8 million premature deaths. 

##### Maximising the aid effort
Each year, funds have to be allocated across regions, countries, and types of immunisations.


### Funding vaccinations around the world
The vaccination strategy has to focus both on short and long term goals - immediately saving lives and pursuing sustainability.

##### Prioritising across countries and immunisations
Immunisation funds are targeted at regions where there would otherwise be an undersupply and lives are at stake.
Immunisations for diseases that pose an immediate risk to children are targeted.
Specific factors play a role:  

* some immunisations require multiple doses at separate times  
* some diseases are on the brink of eradication

## Challenge
Generate data insights to effectively support a worldwide vaccination effort.


### Description and deliverables
Use cutting-edge analytics to come up with a strategy that ensures funds for vaccinations have maximum impact.

##### Challenge description

Each year, our NGO has to allocate its budget across immunisation types and countries. This allocation of funds plays a crucial role in determining how effective the immunisation initiative is (i.e., how many lives are saved as a result of it).
Our NGO has approached you, a team of independent analytics consultants, to help them plan their investments for the next 5 years. They are looking for a recommendation for how much to invest in what immunisations and what countries. Your model should depend on the following parameters: 

* Objective: save as many children‘s (< age 10) lives as possible  
* Budget: USD 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) per year
* Time horizon: 5 years
* Countries: all countries where our NGO has previously funded immunisation programs
* Immunisations: all types of immunisations that our NGO has previously funded

##### 3 poissible challenges
1. **Efficiency calculations**
Help the NGO understand where to invest the available money to save most children's lives. Visualise the data in a meaningful way using bar charts / line charts etc. and make a recommendation to the NGO where their money can be deployed most effectively.
2. **Investment strategies**
Identify different investment strategies for the NGO using clustering and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each option.
3. **Correlating factors**
Help the NGO identify correlations between different influencing factors. Therefore,  build different regression models, compare their results and present the NGO with possible correlations and causalities of input factors you identified.


### Data sources
You will be relying on data sets that are open to the public – and are you free to add your own data (if openly available). In order to get rapidly started, and because you only have couple of hours for this challenge, we've prepared a simplified dataset.

##### Summarized data  
* [Dataset for the WIT Challenge](https://github.com/DeloitteHackathon/AnalyticsChallenge/blob/master/Data/Dataset%20for%20the%20WIT%20Challenge%20.csv)

##### NGO data  
* [Detailed information on NGO’s disbursement from 2000 to 2016](https://github.com/DeloitteHackathon/AnalyticsChallenge/blob/master/Data/NGO_DataDisbursement.csv)


##### WHO data  
* [Coverage by vaccines for each country 1980-2015](https://github.com/DeloitteHackathon/AnalyticsChallenge/blob/master/Data/WHO_Coverage_estimates.csv)  


##### World bank data
* Birth rate, death rate, life expectancy, fertility rate, …
* Prevalence of obesity, malnourishment, vaccine waste
* International migrant numbers, net migration, refugee population by country or territory of origin 
* GDP, poverty headcount
* Air pollution, improved sanitation facilities, water source


Ideas for supplementary data:
* Number of reported cases of Haemophilus influenzae Disease (Including HiB)  
* Forecasts of epidemics  
* Forecast of destabilizing elections
* GDP growth (meaning country can found own effort)
* Data on innovations for new ways of delivering vaccines in difficult circumstances 
* etc.



### Hints
Do not get overwhelmed by the data and remember to enjoy yourselves!

* You don’t have much time to come up with the final presentation, so possibly split the work between team members.
* Half the work is formalizing the problem. You will have to make assumptions. Make sure you explain why you made them.
* Check the data you are provided: even though we already did quite some cleaning for you, check whether the data you work with is consistent and exclude data points where needed.
* We are dealing with a serious topic but after all this is just a fun challenge. Try to wow us and your competitors with cool visualisations and solid analysis. (Remember however: the recommendation is the final product of your work) 


### Presentation
Each team will present their work in front of a group of judges

##### Format
* 4 min pitch
* 4 min QA

##### Content
* Introduce team
* Problem Statement
* Presentation of solution
* Demo

### Evaluations
A number of clearly defined criteria will be used in the evaluation of your work. Each team’s work will be evaluated as a whole.

##### Analytics
* Data indentification and integrity
* Clearly state hypothesis

##### Visualisations
* Direct attention to the key message
* Appropriate chart type
* Accurate units of measurement
* Keep it clear
* Visuals are appealing

##### Presentation
* Provides clear and well-founded recommendations
* Solves the initial business problem with actionable recommendations
* Is well-structured
* Tells a compelling story
* Is within the time limit

## Logistics

### Teams  
Good collaboration within the team will be key success factor. 

Each participant will be part of a team of 3-5 people.
People are free to team up as they wish (we recommend a good mix of skillsets in the same team: technical, business and presentation skills). 

We suggest that you look for the following qualities in your team:
* Experience with data visualisation
* Experience with statistics/machine learning
* Experience with business presentations/pitches
